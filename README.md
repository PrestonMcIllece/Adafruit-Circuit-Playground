# Adafruit-Circuit-Playground
Using bash, C and Arduino, we built a very simple website that interacts with the circuit playground depending on the query string input. The circuit playground will display either red, green, blue, or rainbow lights or play a sound based on what the query string of the website is. Additionally, the website will display different headings that align with the output of the circuit playground. This project was done on a Raspberry Pi 3.
